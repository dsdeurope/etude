The AI engineer successfully cloned the provided GitHub repository, dsdeurope/etude, and set up the full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application. Initial tasks focused on making the application runnable and providing a preview. Subsequent efforts addressed several UI/UX issues: centering the 0% progress indicator and API button, aligning all seven control buttons on a single line with equidistant spacing, and refining container padding. A significant technical challenge involved correcting frontend syntax errors (missing/extra  tags, double declarations) that led to white screens. The AI then integrated dynamic content generation for biblical characters, initially using Emergent LLM (later reverted due to user request) and then exclusively Gemini API keys with a robust rotation and fallback mechanism. Finally, the AI restored and re-integrated the 30 Thèmes Essentiels section, transitioning it from static data to dynamic verse retrieval via the backend API. The last task initiated was to ensure each theme provides a minimum of 20 verses.

<product_requirements>
The user's core request was to clone and improve the Bible Study AI application from the  GitHub repository. The application, once set up, should function as an interactive Bible study tool.

Key features and improvements requested/implemented so far:
1.  **Application Setup**: Clone the repository, explore the codebase, set up the tech stack (React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB), install dependencies, and run services using Supervisor to provide a live preview.
2.  **UI/UX Enhancements**:
    *   **Centering**: Ensure the 0% progress indicator and the API status button are perfectly centered horizontally on the page and the API button is directly below the 0%.
    *   **Button Alignment**: Align all 7 control buttons (RESET, VIOLET MYSTIQUE, GENÈSE 1, GEMINI GRATUIT, VERSETS PROG, GÉNÉRER, BIBLE CONCORDANCE) on a single line with equidistant spacing.
    *   **Container Disposition**: Adjust the padding and overall disposition of the control buttons container, applying a glassmorphism effect.
3.  **Dynamic Content Generation (Biblical Characters)**:
    *   Replace static/mock data for biblical character histories (e.g., Barak) with dynamically generated content.
    *   Initially, this was implemented using Emergent LLM, but the user explicitly requested to use their provided Gemini API keys instead.
    *   Implement a robust API key rotation system for Gemini keys, with a fallback to the Bible API if all Gemini keys fail due to quota issues.
4.  **Dynamic Content Generation (30 Essential Themes)**:
    *   Restore the 30 Thèmes Essentiels de la Sainte Bible section, which was accidentally removed during earlier refactoring.
    *   Connect these themes to the backend API to dynamically retrieve relevant verses (e.g., for Amour et Charité), including YouVersion clickable links.
    *   **Pending**: Ensure a minimum of 20 verses are retrieved per theme.

-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **API Integration**: Gemini API for content generation (character histories, thematic verses), Bible API as a fallback.
-   **API Key Management**: Intelligent rotation of multiple Gemini API keys, quota detection, and fallback logic.
-   **Frontend Styling**: Tailwind CSS, custom CSS for glassmorphism, flexbox, and grid layouts.
-   **Environment Management**:  files for sensitive keys (MONGO_URL, GEMINI_API_KEYs), backend                          RUNNING   pid 41, uptime 0:00:02

<pending_tasks>
-   Ensure that when a user selects a Thème Biblique, the backend API (via ) returns a minimum of 20 relevant verses.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's explicit feedback that the 30 Thèmes Essentiels section, specifically when a theme like Amour et Charité is selected, was only returning 3 verses instead of the requested minimum of 20. The AI had acknowledged this and started implementing changes to  and potentially backend logic to improve the verse retrieval strategy and guarantee more verses. Specifically, the AI had made two  calls to  (Chat Messages 685 and 687) aimed at adding new functions and logic to ensure the 20+ verses requirement is met.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Continue modifying  and potentially  to ensure that at least 20 verses are fetched for each selected biblical theme.
