The AI engineer's trajectory showcases an iterative, diagnostic, and problem-solving approach to enhancing a biblical study application. Initially, it involved cleaning unused code and preparing for Vercel deployment of an existing 10-key Gemini setup. User feedback then shifted focus to improving the quality of 28-rubric content generation, which led to the implementation of detailed prompts in . Subsequent issues with API key quotas revealed both an incorrect Gemini model ( vs. ) used in health checks and a critical discovery of invalid/exhausted keys. The AI integrated 14 new user-provided keys, verified them, and successfully generated high-quality rubric content. To manage quota usage, health check and rubric content caching were implemented. The final phase involved troubleshooting Vercel deployment, addressing hardcoded frontend LED counts, and crucially, identifying and fixing a CORS policy issue preventing the Vercel frontend from communicating correctly with the remote Kubernetes backend. The current state is that the CORS fix has been applied locally, but the remote backend still needs to reflect this change, leading to incorrect LED statuses on Vercel.

<product_requirements>
The application aims to provide a comprehensive biblical study experience. Core features include a Verset par verset study with progressive generation (3 verses/batch, previously 5) structured into VERSET, CHAPITRE, CONTEXTE HISTORIQUE, PARTIE THÃ‰OLOGIQUE, and a dynamic 28 Rubriques study. Key requirements involve: API key rotation (initially 5, then 10, now 14 Gemini keys + Bible API), an API control panel with dynamic LED status, and generating detailed Character History (800-1500 words). UI demands horizontal alignment for seven primary action buttons. The Verset par verset feature needed unique content per batch and removal of API usage notes. Recent explicit requests centered on improving the quality of the 28-rubric content generation to be specific and differentiated according to each rubric's description, integrating 14 new Gemini keys, optimizing quota usage (caching), and resolving Vercel deployment inconsistencies, particularly the display of API key statuses (LEDs) and frontend-backend communication (CORS).

The application uses a full-stack architecture with a FastAPI backend, a React frontend, and MongoDB. The  directory serves as the staging area for Vercel deployments.



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The core FastAPI application handling all API logic, LLM calls, and database interactions.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Defined 28 detailed  for dynamic content generation, replacing static/generic prompts.
        -   Corrected the Gemini model in  from  to  to accurately check API key health.
        -   Corrected the Gemini model in  from  to  to ensure successful LLM calls and prevent unintended Bible API fallbacks.
        -   Implemented a caching mechanism for  status checks to reduce quota consumption.
        -   Implemented a MongoDB caching system for generated rubric content to store and retrieve previously generated studies.
        -   Updated  to dynamically include the Vercel frontend URL () to resolve cross-origin request issues.
        -   Updated to load 14 Gemini API keys from  and modified  logic for rotation.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores backend environment variables, including API keys.
    -   **Changes**: Extended  entries (up to ) to accommodate the 14 user-provided Gemini API keys.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays the status (LEDs) of API keys.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Updated the initial  state to dynamically represent 14 Gemini keys and 1 Bible API key, correcting the hardcoded 4-key display issue.
        -   Enhanced error handling and added debug logging for  calls to provide better insights into API communication issues and reflect accurate statuses (e.g., yellow for fetch errors in case of failure).
-   ** (and , )**:
    -   **Importance**: Previously contained static rubric content.
    -   **Changes**: Cleared the file content and added a comment indicating it is **obsolete** and no longer used (replaced by dynamic generation via ).
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Staging directory for Vercel deployments. All relevant backend and frontend changes are consistently copied here.
    -   **New Documentation Files**: Several  files were created to document changes, diagnostics, and deployment steps.
    -   **New Script Files**: , .

<pending_tasks>
-   The CORS fix for the remote Kubernetes/Emergent backend needs to be applied and verified to ensure the Vercel frontend correctly displays the real-time API key statuses (red for exhausted, green for available).
-   The user still needs to perform full quality testing of the 28-rubric generation once API quotas reset.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively troubleshooting a discrepancy between the API key LED statuses displayed on the Vercel frontend and the actual statuses reported by the Kubernetes backend. The Vercel frontend was showing all LEDs as yellow, whereas the Kubernetes backend correctly indicated 14 keys were exhausted (red).

The diagnostic process led to the discovery of a **CORS policy error** in the Vercel frontend's browser console, indicating that the remote Kubernetes backend (at ) was blocking requests from the Vercel origin ().

The AI successfully applied a fix locally by modifying  to dynamically include  in the  allowed list. This local fix was verified using , showing that  was now correctly set, implying the CORS issue was resolved for the local backend.

However, the user reported that the Vercel frontend still showed yellow LEDs. This indicated that the CORS fix had not yet been deployed or reflected on the **remote Kubernetes backend** that the Vercel frontend is configured to communicate with. The yellow status on Vercel likely reflects the frontend's updated error handling in , which now catches the  error (due to CORS) and sets the LEDs to an error state (yellow), instead of the previous default green.

The immediate next step the AI was about to take was to verify the remote backend's configuration to ensure the CORS changes were active there.
