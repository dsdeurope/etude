The AI engineer's trajectory shows an iterative problem-solving approach. It began by addressing the user's explicit requests to refine Verset par verset presentation by structuring content and removing an API usage note, which involved modifying  and . Initial backend testing showed some success, but subsequent user feedback highlighted issues with content uniqueness across batches and general quality for rubrics, and recurring UI and deployment problems.

The AI diagnosed and resolved several critical issues:
1.  **Verset par verset content uniqueness**: Improved backend prompts and Bible API fallback logic with a hash algorithm.
2.  **API key quota management**: Corrected  to increment usage only on *successful* Gemini API calls, preventing premature quota exhaustion.
3.  **Vercel Failed to fetch errors**: Identified browser/Vercel timeouts as the cause, increasing frontend  timeouts and reducing the Verset par verset batch size from 5 to 3 to meet Vercel's 10-second limit.
4.  **UI button alignment**: Reinstated a missing inline CSS  property in  for horizontal alignment.
5.  **Character History fallback**: Added a Bible API fallback to the  endpoint.
6.  **Rubric content generation**: Discovered rubric content was static. Created a new backend endpoint () with dedicated prompts and updated the frontend to consume it for dynamic generation.

The trajectory concluded with the successful integration of 10 new Gemini API keys, verified for rotation and availability, and the user's request to push all corrections to Vercel.

The application's core goal is to provide a comprehensive biblical study experience. Initially, it involved fixing a 404 deployment error on Vercel, establishing an API control panel with dynamic LED status based on API quotas, and implementing a  endpoint. A critical UI requirement was ensuring seven primary action buttons (, , , , , , ) maintain horizontal alignment on desktop. For character history, detailed, narrative paragraphs (800-1500 words) covering biblical history, past, present, future, and genealogy were needed, with Enrichir and Régénérer modes. API key management required a 5-key rotation system (Gemini and Bible API). The Verset par verset feature needed progressive content generation (originally 5 verses at a time, later adjusted to 3 for Vercel) with a specific, organized display format (affichage du verset, chapitre, Contexte historique, partie théologique) and removal of a temporary API usage note. Subsequently, the user requested unique content per batch, avoidance of duplicates, improved generation quality for rubrics, and optimized API key usage (correcting quota counting). Most recently, 10 Gemini API keys were provided for integration to increase capacity.

The application employs a full-stack architecture with a FastAPI backend, a React frontend, and MongoDB for data persistence. A  directory is used as the staging area for Vercel deployments, mirroring the frontend structure.



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The central FastAPI application defining all API endpoints.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Removed the API usage note (line 211).
        -   Modified the prompt for  to generate 4 distinct sections (VERSET, CHAPITRE, CONTEXTE HISTORIQUE, PARTIE THÉOLOGIQUE).
        -   Improved  to generate more unique content using a hash algorithm and restructured it for 4 sections.
        -   Corrected the  parsing for  to handle verse ranges correctly.
        -   Modified  to increment  only on successful API calls to optimize quota usage.
        -   Added a Bible API fallback to the  endpoint.
        -   Created a new endpoint  with 28 detailed prompts for dynamic rubric content generation using Gemini API. This endpoint was carefully placed before  to ensure it was discoverable.
        -   Updated to load and use 10 Gemini API keys from  and  logic.
        -   Adjusted  logic in  to generate 3 verses per batch instead of 5 for Vercel timeout compatibility.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores backend environment variables, including API keys.
    -   **Changes**: Added 6 more  entries (up to ) to accommodate the 10 user-provided Gemini API keys.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main React component, orchestrating UI and route rendering.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Re-added inline style  to the  div for desktop button alignment, fixing a regression.
        -   Added a 60-second timeout to  calls in  and improved loading/error states to handle Vercel timeouts.
        -   Modified  to call the new  endpoint instead of the old static/non-existent one.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Page for Verset par verset study, deployed to Vercel.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Implemented logic to parse and display the 4 sections (VERSET, CHAPITRE, CONTEXTE HISTORIQUE, PARTIE THÉOLOGIQUE).
        -   Added CSS styles for the new sections.
        -   Added a 60-second timeout to the  call and improved error handling for API calls.
        -   Adjusted batch size to 3 verses (from 5) to accommodate Vercel's 10-second timeout, updating display logic and Continuer button text accordingly.

<pending_tasks>
-   The rubrique_functions.js file still contains hardcoded static content. While the frontend now bypasses it, the file itself could be cleaned up or removed if no longer serving any purpose.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully integrated 10 new Gemini API keys. This involved updating  with the new keys (from  to ) and modifying  to ensure the  list was populated with all 10 keys and the  function could rotate through them. The  endpoint's status reporting was verified to correctly display the status of all 10 keys, all showing as green (available). The AI copied the updated  to  and created  to document the increased API capacity. The user's last instruction was tu dois pousser ver vercel (You must push to Vercel), indicating the immediate next step is to deploy these latest changes.
